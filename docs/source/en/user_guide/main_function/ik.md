# ðŸ¦¾ Inverse Kinematics (IK)

MotrixSim provides an efficient and easy-to-use Inverse Kinematics (IK) solver located in the `motrixsim.ik` module. Currently, it supports a Gauss-Newton-based IK solver ([`GaussNewtonSolver`]) and a simple IK chain model ([`IkChain`]).

## Basic Concepts

Inverse Kinematics (IK) is the process of calculating the joint parameters required to achieve a specific position and orientation of a robot's end-effector (e.g., a robotic arm's gripper). In contrast, Forward Kinematics calculates the position and orientation of the end-effector based on known joint parameters. The IK computation process can be expressed as: `joint_dof_pos = compute_inverse_kinematic(ik_model, end_effector_pose)`.

## IK Model

The IK model defines the structure and constraints of the IK problem. Currently, MotrixSim only supports chain structures (IKChain) composed of single-degree-of-freedom joints (Hinge, Slide).

### IK Chain

An IK chain model consists of a series of connected joints and an end-effector, as shown below:

![ikchain](/_static/images/ikchain.png)

In MotrixSim, you can create an IK chain model as follows:

```{literalinclude} ../../../../examples/ik.py
:language: python
:dedent:
:start-after: "# tag::create_ik_chain"
:end-before:  "# end::create_ik_chain"
```

The code above creates an IK chain model by specifying the end link and an optional starting link. You can also define the offset of the end-effector relative to the end link using the `end_effector_offset` parameter.

Refer to the API documentation for more details about [`IkChain`].

## IK Solver

After defining the IKModel, you can use an IK Solver to perform the actual IK solving. MotrixSim currently supports a Gauss-Newton-based IK solver [`GaussNewtonSolver`].

### Gauss-Newton IK Solver

The Gauss-Newton method is an iterative optimization algorithm for nonlinear least squares problems. It linearizes the nonlinear function and uses the least squares method to update parameter estimates, gradually approaching the target value. In IK solving, the Gauss-Newton method iteratively adjusts joint parameters to make the end-effector's position and orientation as close as possible to the target position and orientation.

In MotrixSim, you can create a Gauss-Newton IK solver as follows:

```{literalinclude} ../../../../examples/ik.py
:language: python
:dedent:
:start-after: "# tag::create_ik_solver"
:end-before:  "# end::create_ik_solver"
```

Then, execute the IK solving process by calling the `solve` method:

```{literalinclude} ../../../../examples/ik.py
:language: python
:dedent:
:start-after: "# tag::solve_ik"
:end-before:  "# end::solve_ik"
```

The `solve` method returns a `numpy.ndarray` object with the shape `(*data.shape, chain.num_dof_pos + 2)`, where `chain.num_dof_pos` is the number of degrees of freedom in the IK chain. The additional two elements represent the solver's convergence status and the number of iterations.

```{note}
When using the IK Solver, it may sometimes fail to converge. Possible reasons include:

- The target position is outside the robot arm's workspace.
- The IK process does not consider constraints such as collisions.
- The initial pose of the robot arm is too far from the target, making it impossible to converge within the set number of iterations.
- ...

```
